Unfortunately to fully automate uninstalling and reinstalling of MS Teams it requires more than one file to be used. 
You have to right click the Teams_Reinstall_START.bat file > Run as admin and it will go through the scripts to fully uninstall, clear cache folders, and reinstall. 
ALL of these files in this folder are required, copy this entire folder (Teams) over to users desktop if needed.
Do not manually run any other file except the START one.
