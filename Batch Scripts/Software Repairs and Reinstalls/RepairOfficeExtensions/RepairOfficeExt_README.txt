This is only used if office programs wont open in the correct application. (For ex: If a .xls file isnt recognized by Excel or .docx file wont open in word)
Sometimes you cant change the default file extensions in the settings because it wont show the office program you need to select. This fixes that.

You have to right click the Repair_Office_Extensions.bat file > Run as admin and it will go through the scripts to fully uninstall, clear cache folders, and reinstall. 
ALL of these files in this folder are required, copy this entire folder (RepairOfficeExtensions) over to users desktop if needed.
Do not manually run any other file except the START one.
